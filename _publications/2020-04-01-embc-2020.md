excerpt: 'The paper describes the classification of ultrasound information and its mapping onto a soft robotic gripper. In our real-time ultrasound-based control of a soft robotic gripper pipeline, we were able to train a machine learning model to classify 4 hand grasping configurations with an average accuracy percentage of 93%. The paper is a step toward intuitive and robust biosignal-based control methods for robots.'

The paper describes the classification of ultrasound information and its mapping onto a soft robotic gripper. In our real-time ultrasound-based control of a soft robotic gripper pipeline, we were able to train a machine learning model to classify 4 hand grasping configurations with an average accuracy percentage of 93%. The paper is a step toward intuitive and robust biosignal-based control methods for robots.
