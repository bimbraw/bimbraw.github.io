<p align="justify">
I am a Robotics PhD candidate at <a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/medicalfusionlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WPI's Medical FUSION Lab</a>, where my research focuses on the application of machine learning to ultrasound image processing. My interests lie in leveraging AI/ML to enable real-time unimodal and multi-modal biosignal-based predictions. My research has broad applicability in domains such as robotic teleoperation, AR/VR, rehabilitation robotics, robot-assisted surgery, and gaming.</p>

<p align="justify">
I worked as a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.merl.com/research/computational-sensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts under the Computational Sensing Division over Summer 2023. In the Summer and Fall of 2022, I worked as an <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/keshav-bimbraw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augmented Human Sensing Researcher</a> (Intern/Co-Op) at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nokia Bell Labs</a>' Artificial Intelligence Research Lab in the New York City Metropolitan Area.</p>

<p align="justify">
Additionally, I have experience as an Active Noise Control Engineering intern at <a href="https://automotive.bose.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bose</a> (Automotive Systems Division) and as an Audio DSP Engineer. I hold a Master's in <a href="https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/robotic-musicianship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Technology</a> from <a href="https://www.news.gatech.edu/2018/11/06/getting-know-georgia-tech-keshav-bimbraw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia Tech</a> (Spring 2019) and completed a research internship at IIT Delhi while pursuing my B.E. in <a href="http://www.thapar.edu/programmes/pages/btech-in-mechatronics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mechatronics Engineering</a> at Thapar University. <a href="http://bimbraw.github.io/files/Keshav_Bimbraw_Resume_Summer_2023.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>. <a href="http://bimbraw.github.io/files/Keshav_Bimbraw_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.</p>
